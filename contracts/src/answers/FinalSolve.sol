        // 1. ANIMAL_MASK = (type(uint80).max << 160) + 16
        //    This sets bit 4 in addition to bits 160-239
        
        // 2. In changeAnimal with empty string:
        //    carousel[crateId] = carousel[crateId] & (ANIMAL_MASK | NEXT_ID_MASK)
        //    This preserves: animal bits + next ID bits + bit 4
        
        // 3. In setAnimalAndSpin:
        //    The encoded animal is XORed after being shifted and having 16 added
        
        // Current state:
        // - currentCrateId = 1
        // - carousel[0] = 1 << 160 (nextId = 1)
        // - carousel[1] = has our exploit contract as owner
        
        // What if the goal is to have a crate owned by address(16)?
        // Since the mask preserves bit 4, an owner at address(16) = address(0x10)
        // would remain even after changeAnimal("", crateId)!
        
        // Let me create such a situation
        
        // First, I need to be at a crate that points to another crate
        // where I can set the owner to have bit 4 set
        
        // Actually, simpler idea: what if currentCrateId needs to equal 0
        // and carousel[0] needs to equal 0?
        
        // To get currentCrateId back to 0, we need to wrap around
        // But carousel[0] currently points to 1, so we can't naturally get back
        
        // Unless we modify the pointers...

        // We can't directly modify currentCrateId
        // But what if there's a crate that points to 0?
        
        // Let me try to create a cycle back to 0
        // Current: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> ...
        
        // If I could make crate 2 point to 0, then:
        // 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0 (cycle)
        
        // But I can only set sequential next pointers...
        
        // Actually, let me re-read the setAnimalAndSpin code carefully
        // It sets: ((nextCrateId + 1) % MAX_CAPACITY) << 160
        
        // So crate N always points to crate (N+1) % 65535
        // We can't create arbitrary links
